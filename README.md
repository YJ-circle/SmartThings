### The role of Edge Driver:

- **Handling Device Protocols**:  
  Manage communication between IoT devices and the hub using protocols like Zigbee and Matter.

- **Monitoring Device States**:  
  Keep an eye on changes in device states (e.g., turning switches on/off, temperature shifts) and set up actions accordingly.

- **Managing Events and Automations**:  
  Create logic to automatically perform tasks when certain events happen (e.g., at specific times or when a sensor is triggered).

- **Sending Commands to Devices**:  
  Program the hub to send commands to devices (e.g., adjusting light brightness, locking doors).
