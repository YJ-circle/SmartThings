# Edge Drivers

_Edge Driver_ is crucial to the local operation of the SmartThings platform, facilitating communication between IoT devices and the SmartThings hub.

_Local operation_ ensures that the system functions properly even in environments without internet access.

### The role of Edge Driver:

- **Handling Device Protocols**:  
  Manage communication between IoT devices and the hub using protocols like Zigbee and Matter.

- **Monitoring Device States**:  
  Monitor changes in device states (e.g., turning switches on/off, temperature fluctuations) and initiate actions accordingly.

- **Managing Events and Automations**:  
  Develop logic to automatically perform tasks when specific events occur (e.g., at certain times or when a sensor is triggered).

- **Sending Commands to Devices**:  
  Instruct the hub to send commands to devices (e.g., adjusting light brightness, locking doors).
